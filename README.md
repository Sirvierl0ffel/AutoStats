# AutoStats
 AutoStats is a LabyMod addon, which can query statistics of players and display them in the tab list.
 
 <p>Right now only GommeHD.net is supported, but any suggestion for other servers are welcome. Just post them on my discord: https://discord.gg/UDGV5mh<p>

 <p>New extensions and their source will be uploaded to this page.</p>

 AutoStats adds folowing commands:<br>
 /copysas: Copies the state info to the clipboard, used for developing of extensions.<br>
 /continueas: Starts again, if AutoStats stopped.<br>
